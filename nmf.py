# TODO 1 : As per (3), try to write the algorithm so it does one iteration, and produces two new matrices
# TODO 2 : As per (2), try to write a function that has that specific objective function and iterates based on that (also check other possible objective functions)
# TODO 3 : As per (1), use the example matrix in github code, and compare results of your own
